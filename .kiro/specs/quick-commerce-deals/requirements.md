# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive price comparison platform for quick commerce applications (Blinkit, Zepto, Instamart, BigBasket Now, etc.) that enables users to track real-time pricing, discounts, and availability across multiple platforms for thousands of products using natural language queries. The system will provide intelligent SQL query generation, semantic table selection, and optimized performance for high-frequency updates and concurrent queries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Schema Design

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want a comprehensive database schema that can handle multi-platform product data, so that I can store and manage pricing, discount, and availability information efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL create a database schema with at least 50+ tables covering products, prices, discounts, availability, and platform data
2. WHEN product data is stored THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity across all related tables
3. WHEN price updates occur THEN the system SHALL support high-frequency updates without data corruption
4. IF a new platform is added THEN the system SHALL accommodate the new platform data without schema changes

### Requirement 2: Real-time Data Integration

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want simulated real-time price updates across all platforms, so that users can access current pricing information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL simulate real-time price updates with dummy data across all supported platforms
2. WHEN price data is updated THEN the system SHALL process updates within 1 second
3. WHEN multiple platforms update simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent updates without conflicts
4. IF a platform becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operating with available platform data

### Requirement 3: Natural Language SQL Agent

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to query product information using natural language, so that I can find pricing and deals without writing SQL queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a natural language query THEN the system SHALL convert it to appropriate SQL queries
2. WHEN complex queries are submitted THEN the system SHALL intelligently select relevant tables from 50+ available tables
3. WHEN multi-table queries are needed THEN the system SHALL determine optimal join paths automatically
4. IF a query is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL request clarification or provide multiple interpretations

### Requirement 4: Intelligent Table Selection and Query Planning

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want semantic indexing and intelligent query planning, so that the system can efficiently handle complex queries across many tables.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL build semantic indexes for all database tables
2. WHEN a query is processed THEN the system SHALL select only relevant tables based on semantic analysis
3. WHEN join operations are needed THEN the system SHALL determine the optimal join path
4. WHEN query complexity is high THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize the query execution plan

### Requirement 5: Multi-step Query Generation with Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want multi-step query generation with validation, so that complex queries are broken down and verified at each step.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complex queries are generated THEN the system SHALL break them into logical steps
2. WHEN each query step is created THEN the system SHALL validate the step before proceeding
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide error details and suggest corrections
4. IF intermediate results are needed THEN the system SHALL store and reuse them efficiently

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want fast query responses even with large datasets, so that I can get pricing information quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large result sets are returned THEN the system SHALL use statistical sampling and pagination
2. WHEN queries are executed THEN the system SHALL utilize schema caching and query result caching
3. WHEN database connections are needed THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling
4. WHEN query performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically analyze and optimize queries

### Requirement 7: LangChain Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to leverage LangChain's SQLDatabaseToolkit with custom extensions, so that I can build upon proven NLP-to-SQL capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is built THEN it SHALL integrate LangChain version 0.3 or above
2. WHEN SQL queries are generated THEN the system SHALL use SQLDatabaseToolkit as the foundation
3. WHEN custom functionality is needed THEN the system SHALL extend the toolkit with custom components
4. IF LangChain updates are available THEN the system SHALL remain compatible with newer versions

### Requirement 8: FastAPI Backend Implementation

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a well-structured FastAPI backend, so that I can build responsive user interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is deployed THEN it SHALL provide RESTful APIs using FastAPI
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL respond with appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON responses
3. WHEN concurrent requests occur THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently
4. IF API errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and logging

### Requirement 9: Streamlit Frontend Interface

**User Story:** As an end user, I want an intuitive web interface, so that I can easily query and compare prices across platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the platform THEN they SHALL see a Streamlit-based web interface
2. WHEN users enter natural language queries THEN the interface SHALL display results in a user-friendly format
3. WHEN price comparisons are shown THEN the interface SHALL highlight the best deals and discounts
4. IF no results are found THEN the interface SHALL suggest alternative queries or products

### Requirement 10: Sample Query Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to execute specific types of queries like finding cheapest products and comparing prices, so that I can make informed purchasing decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users ask "Which app has cheapest onions right now?" THEN the system SHALL return current lowest prices across all platforms
2. WHEN users request "Show products with 30%+ discount on Blinkit" THEN the system SHALL filter and display qualifying products
3. WHEN users ask "Compare fruit prices between Zepto and Instamart" THEN the system SHALL show side-by-side price comparisons
4. WHEN users request "Find best deals for â‚¹1000 grocery list" THEN the system SHALL optimize product selection within budget

### Requirement 11: Security and Rate Limiting

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want basic security measures and rate limiting, so that the platform remains stable and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting per user/IP
2. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log and potentially block requests
3. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL prevent SQL injection attacks
4. IF rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses

### Requirement 12: Monitoring and Documentation

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want comprehensive monitoring and documentation, so that I can maintain and improve the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL monitor query performance and database connections
2. WHEN system metrics are collected THEN they SHALL be accessible through monitoring interfaces
3. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL include comprehensive architecture documentation
4. IF performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs and metrics for troubleshooting
